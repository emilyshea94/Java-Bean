# Java-Bean
P.A.S.S.W.O.R.D

For this task I modified code to make a working password generator that generates a password with 8-128 characacters and displays the password as a alert writen on the page. I chose to lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or a special character. 
This application generates a randomized password when you click on the "generate password" button. 







this challenge was quite challenging for me as I had to move around code several times. A simple missing semi-colon would throw me off for a while.
I got frustrated because my CSS and java was not showing up in my index.html for a while so I had to move around my files in VS code. That set me back a bit.
